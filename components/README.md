# Components

Components are functions that perform certain tasks using the WMTK toolkit. They are used within one or several applications.

## Components VS Applications

While applications can contain messy and undocumented sections of code, components are expected to be refactored, properly tested, and documented. Additionally, they have a well-documented C++ interface. New applications can (or even should) use existing components to avoid rewriting code.
